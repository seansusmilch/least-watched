## Media Sources Safety Rules
- do not under any circumstance write code that will modify data in any external source
- that includes Emby, Sonarr, and Radarr
- you should only write code that READS data from these sources
- never implement delete, update, or create operations for media items
- only use GET requests to external media APIs
- implement proper error handling for API failures
- use read-only API keys when available
- implement rate limiting for API calls to avoid overwhelming external services
- cache API responses to reduce load on external services
- validate all data received from external APIs before processing
- implement proper timeout handling for API calls
- log all API interactions for debugging purposes
- use environment variables for API endpoints and credentials
- implement proper fallback behavior when external services are unavailable
- do not under any circumstance write code that will modify data in any external source
- that includes Emby, Sonarr, and Radarr
