## Media Sources Safety Rules
- do not under any circumstance write code that will modify data in any external source
- that includes Emby, Sonarr, and Radarr
- you should only write code that READS data from these sources
- never implement delete, update, or create operations on any of these APIs
- only use GET requests to external media APIs
- validate all data received from external APIs before processing
- log all API interactions for debugging purposes
- implement proper fallback behavior when external services are unavailable
