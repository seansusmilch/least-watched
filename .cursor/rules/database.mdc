## Database Management Rules

- use prisma for ORM
- use migrations for all database schema changes
- log database operations for debugging and monitoring

### Updating the schema

1. Make schema changes in prisma/schema.prisma
2. Create a migration: bunx prisma migrate dev --name change-name
3. Generate client: bunx prisma generate
