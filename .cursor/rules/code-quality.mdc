- implement proper TypeScript types for all data structures
- implement proper error handling with try-catch blocks
- NEVER write comments unless absolutely necessary
- implement proper separation of concerns
- ALWAYS follow DRY principle. DO NOT REPEAT YOURSELF
- use proper async/await patterns instead of callbacks
- ALWAYS use static imports at the top of the file. DO NOT use dynamic imports
