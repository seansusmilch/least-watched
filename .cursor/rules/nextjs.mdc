## Next.js Development Rules
- use server actions when dealing with client server behavior
- assume the dev server is already running
- when adding things, prefer splitting into different files
- keep files small and single purpose
- use tanstack query for fetching data
- use context7 for documentation
- if a component requires a skeleton, store the skeleton component within the same file
- for importing files, prefer using the @/ alias
- for naming files, prefer kebab case
- use TypeScript for all new files
- prefer server components by default, only use client components when necessary
- use React Server Components for data fetching and server-side rendering
- implement proper error boundaries for client components
- use Next.js built-in Image component for optimized images
- implement proper loading states and error handling
- use Next.js middleware for authentication and routing logic
- prefer static generation (SSG) over server-side rendering (SSR) when possible
- use dynamic imports for code splitting and lazy loading
- implement proper SEO with Next.js Head component or metadata API
- use environment variables for configuration
- implement proper caching strategies with Next.js caching mechanisms
- if a component requires a skeleton, store the skeleton component within the same file
- for importing files, prefer using the @/ alias
